-- The Time of Discovery --

*Sahwit
You see, when I found the
body, I heard the time.

*Sahwit
There was a voice saying the
time... It was probably
coming from the television.

*Sahwit
Oh, but it was three hours
off, wasn't it?

*Sahwit
I guess the victim must
have been watching a video
of a taped program!

*Sahwit
That's why I thought
it was 1:00 PM!

*Sahwit
Terribly sorry about
the misunderstanding...
