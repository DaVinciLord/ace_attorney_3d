-- Witness's Account --

*Sahwit
I was going door-to-door,
selling subscriptions when I saw
a man fleeing an apartment.

*Sahwit
I thought he must be in a
hurry because he left the
door half-open behind him.

*Sahwit
Thinking it strange, I looked
inside the apartment.

*Sahwit
Then I saw her lying there...
A woman... not moving... dead!

*Sahwit
I quailed in fright and found
myself unable to go inside.

*Sahwit
I thought to call the police
immediately!

*Sahwit
However, the phone in her
apartment wasn't working.

*Sahwit
I went to a nearby park and
found a public phone.

*Sahwit
I remember the time exactly:
It was 1:00 PM.

*Sahwit
The man who ran was, without
a doubt, the defendant sitting
right over there.
