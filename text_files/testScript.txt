District Court
Courtroom No. 2

*Judge
The court is now in session for
the trial of Mr. Larry Butz.

*Payne
The prosecution is ready,
Your Honor.

*Phoenix
The, um, defense is ready,
Your Honor.

*Judge
Ahem.

*Judge
Mr. Wright?

*Judge
This is your first trial,
is it not?

*Phoenix
Y-Yes, Your Honor.
I'm, um, a little nervous.

*Judge
Your conduct during this
trial will decide the fate
of your client.

*Judge
Murder is a serious charge.
For your client's sake, I hope
you can control your nerves.

*Phoenix
Thank... thank you, Your Honor.

*Judge
...

*Judge
Mr. Wright, given the
circumstances...

*Judge
I think we should have a test
to ascertain your readiness.

*Phoenix
Yes, Your Honor.

*Phoenix
(Gulp... Hands shaking...
Eyesight... fading...)

*Judge
This test will consist of a
few simple questions. Answer
them clearly and concisely.

[QCM]->1

*Judge
Next question:

*Judge
This is a murder trial. Tell me,
what's the victim's name?

*Phoenix
(Whew, I know this one! Glad
I read the case report cover
to cover so many times.)

*Phoenix
(It's... wait... Uh-oh!)

*Phoenix
(No... no way! I forgot!
I'm drawing a total blank
here!)

*Mia
Phoenix! Are you absolutely
SURE you're up to this?

*Mia
You don't even know the
victim's name!?

*Phoenix
Oh, the victim! O-Of course
I know the victim's name!

*Phoenix
I, um, just forgot.
... Temporarily.

*Mia
I think I feel a migraine
coming on.

*Mia
Look, the defendant's name
is listed in the Court Record.

*Mia
Just touch the Court Record
button to check it at anytime,
okay?

*Mia
Remember to check it often.
Do it for me, please.
I'm begging you.

*Judge
Now, tell me, what
was the cause of death?

++
[QCM]->3

*Judge
You've answered all my
questions. I see no reason
why we shouldn't proceed.

*Judge
You seem much more relaxed,
Mr. Wright. Good for you.

*Phoenix
Thank you, Your Honor.
(Because I don't FEEL
relaxed, that's for sure.)

*Judge
Well, then...

*Judge
First, a question for the
prosecution. Mr. Payne?

*Payne
Yes, Your Honor?

*Judge
As Mr. Wright just told us,
the victim was struck with
a blunt object.

*Judge
Would you explain to the court
just what that "object" was?

*Payne
The murder weapon was this
statue of "The Thinker."

*Payne
It was found lying on the
floor, next to the victim.

*Judge
I see... the court accepts
it into evidence.

Statue added to
the Court Record.

*Mia
Wright...

*Mia
Be sure to pay attention to
any evidence added during
the trial.

*Mia
That evidence is the only
ammunition you have in court.

*Mia
Touch the Court Record
button to check the Court
Record frequently.

*Judge
Mr. Payne, the prosecution
may call its first witness.

*Payne
The prosecution calls the
defendant, Mr. Butz, to the
stand.

*Phoenix
Um, Chief, what do I do now?

*Mia
Pay attention. You don't want
to miss any information that
might help your client's case.

*Mia
You'll get your chance to
respond to the prosecution
later, so be ready!

*Mia
Let's just hope he doesn't
say anything... unfortunate.

*Phoenix
(Uh oh, Larry gets excited
easily... this could be bad.)
