You found the body at 1:00 PM.
You're sure?

*Sahwit
Yes.
It was 1:00 PM, for certain.

*Phoenix
Frankly, I find that
[DESK_SLAM]->Phoenix Wright
hard to believe!

*Phoenix
Your statement directly
contradicts the autopsy report.

*Phoenix
The autopsy notes the time
of death at sometime after
4PM.

*Phoenix
There was nobody to... er...
no "body" to find at 1:00 PM!

*Phoenix
How do you explain this
three-hour gap?

*Sahwit
!!!

*Sahwit
Oh, that! Oh, er...

*Payne
This is trivial! The witness
merely forgot the time!

*Judge
After his testimony, I find
that hard to believe.

*Judge
Mr. Sahwit...

*Judge
Why were you so certain
that you found the body
at 1:00 PM?

*Sahwit
I.. er... well, I...
Gee, that's a really good
question!

*Mia
Great job, Wright!
Way to put him on the spot!

*Mia
That's all you have to do:
point out contradictions!

*Mia
Lies always beget more lies!

*Mia
See through one, and their
whole story falls apart!

*Sahwit
Wait!
I remember now!

*Judge
Would you care to give
your testimony again?
