Are you sure it was a
television and not... a radio?

*Sahwit
Well, no, I guess it
might have been a radio.

*Payne
Incidentally, there was
no radio on the premises.

*Payne
There was only one
large television.

*Mia

I can't put my finger on it,
but something about this seems

Something about "hearing"
the television...

*Payne
The witness has testified.
He heard the time.
