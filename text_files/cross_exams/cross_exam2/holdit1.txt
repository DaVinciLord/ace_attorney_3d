[HOLD_IT]

*Phoenix
You said "heard"...
Not "saw"?

*Sahwit
Yes, heard.

*Sahwit
All I saw was the body
lying there...

*Sahwit
I didn't think to look at
anything else, least of all
my watch.

*Phoenix
Hmm...
Isn't that a little strange?

*Phoenix
So you're saying you
"heard" something.

*Phoenix
But if you were so shocked by
the body, you wouldn't hear
anything at all!

[OBJECTION]->Payne

*Payne
The witness did say he
actually heard the time.

*Payne
It's ludicrous to suggest
he "wouldn't hear anything"!

*Judge
Hmm...
I have to agree with
the prosecution.

*Judge
Witness, continue
your testimony.
