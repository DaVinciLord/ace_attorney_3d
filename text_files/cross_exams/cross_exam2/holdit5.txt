Are you sure the voice you
heard said it was 1:00 PM?

*Sahwit
Yes, I can practically hear
it now. It was quite clear.

*Judge
Mr. Payne, has the prosecution
verified this testimony?

*Payne
My apologies, Your Honor.

*Payne
I, too, have only just learned
that the witness "heard"
the time.

*Sahwit
Oh, I'm really sorry. I only
remembered it just now.
