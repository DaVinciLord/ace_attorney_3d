The phone in her apartment
wasn't working?

*Sahwit
Yes. I mean, no,
no it wasn't. Right.

*Phoenix
But you said you didn't
go into the apartment...
or did you!?

*Sahwit
Oh, oh, that? I can explain
that!

*Sahwit
There was a cordless phone
on a shelf in the entranceway.

*Sahwit
I reached inside and tried
using that to call...

*Payne
And the phone wasn't
working, correct?

*Payne
What happened next?
