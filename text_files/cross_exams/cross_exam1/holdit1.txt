*Phoenix
Isn't a man leaving an
apartment a common sight?

*Phoenix
I find it odd you would
take notice of him...

*Sahwit
Er... heh.

*Sahwit
I don't know. He just seemed
strange to me, that's all.

*Sahwit
Like he was mad, and yet
frightened at the same time.

*Sahwit
Just like... a criminal fleeing
the scene of a crime!

*Phoenix
The defense requests that
the witness refrain from
conjecture!

*Payne
Of course. What the witness
means is that the man he saw
looked suspicious.

*Payne
So, what happened next?
