*Judge
The court is now in session for
the trial of Mr. Larry Butz.

*Payne
The prosecution is ready,
Your Honor.

*Phoenix
The, um, defense is ready,
Your Honor.

*Judge
Ahem.

*Judge
Mr. Wright?

*Judge
This is your first trial,
is it not?

*Phoenix
Y-Yes, Your Honor.
I'm, um, a little nervous.

*Judge
Your conduct during this
trial will decide the fate
of your client.

*Judge
Murder is a serious charge.
For your client's sake, I hope
you can control your nerves.

*Phoenix
Thank... thank you, Your Honor.

*Judge
...

*Judge
Mr. Wright, given the
circumstances...

*Judge
I think we should have a test
to ascertain your readiness.

*Phoenix
Yes, Your Honor.

*Phoenix
(Gulp... Hands shaking...
Eyesight... fading...)

*Judge
This test will consist of a
few simple questions. Answer
them clearly and concisely.

++
[QCM]->1

*Judge
Next question:

*Judge
This is a murder trial. Tell me,
what's the victim's name?

*Phoenix
(Whew, I know this one! Glad
I read the case report cover
to cover so many times.)

*Phoenix
(It's... wait... Uh-oh!)

*Phoenix
(No... no way! I forgot!
I'm drawing a total blank
here!)

*Mia
Phoenix! Are you absolutely
SURE you're up to this?

*Mia
You don't even know the
victim's name!?

*Phoenix
Oh, the victim! O-Of course
I know the victim's name!

*Phoenix
I, um, just forgot.
... Temporarily.

*Mia
I think I feel a migraine
coming on.

*Mia
Look, the defendant's name
is listed in the Court Record.

*Mia
Just touch the Court Record
button to check it at anytime,
okay?

*Mia
Remember to check it often.
Do it for me, please.
I'm begging you.

++
[QCM]->2

*Judge
Now, tell me, what
was the cause of death?

++
[QCM]->3

*Judge
You've answered all my
questions. I see no reason
why we shouldn't proceed.

*Judge
You seem much more relaxed,
Mr. Wright. Good for you.

*Phoenix
Thank you, Your Honor.
(Because I don't FEEL
relaxed, that's for sure.)

*Judge
Well, then...

*Judge
First, a question for the
prosecution. Mr. Payne?

*Payne
Yes, Your Honor?

*Judge
As Mr. Wright just told us,
the victim was struck with
a blunt object.

*Judge
Would you explain to the court
just what that "object" was?

*Payne
The murder weapon was this
statue of "The Thinker."

*Payne
It was found lying on the
floor, next to the victim.

*Judge
I see... the court accepts
it into evidence.

Statue added to
the Court Record.

++
[EVIDENCE]->2

*Mia
Wright...

*Mia
Be sure to pay attention to
any evidence added during
the trial.

*Mia
That evidence is the only
ammunition you have in court.

*Mia
Touch the Court Record
button to check the Court
Record frequently.

++
[JUDGE_HAMMER]->1

*Judge
Mr. Payne, the prosecution
may call its first witness.

*Payne
The prosecution calls the
defendant, Mr. Butz, to the
stand.

*Phoenix
Um, Chief, what do I do now?

*Mia
Pay attention. You don't want
to miss any information that
might help your client's case.

*Mia
You'll get your chance to
respond to the prosecution
later, so be ready!

*Mia
Let's just hope he doesn't
say anything... unfortunate.

*Phoenix
(Uh oh, Larry gets excited
easily... this could be bad.)

++
[WITNESS]->1

++
[START_MUSIC_TRIAL]

*Payne
Ahem.

*Payne
Mr. Butz. Is it not true that
the victim had recently
dumped you?

*Butz
Hey, watch it buddy!

*Butz
We were great together!
We were Romeo and Juliet,
Cleopatra and Mark Anthony!

*Phoenix
(Um... didn't they all die?)

*Butz
I wasn't dumped! She just
wasn't taking my phone calls.
Or seeing me... Ever.

*Butz
WHAT'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?

*Payne
Mr. Butz, what you describe
is generally what we mean
by "dumped."

*Payne
In fact, she had completely
abandoned you... and was
seeing other men!

*Payne
She had just returned from
overseas with one of them
the day before the murder!

*Butz
Whaddya mean, "one of them"!?

*Butz
Lies! All of it, lies!
I don't believe a word of it!

*Payne
Your Honor, the
victim's passport.

*Payne
According to this, she was
in Paris until the day before
she died.

Passport added to
the Court Record.

++
[EVIDENCE]->3

*Judge
Hmm... Indeed, she appears
to have returned the day
before the murder.

*Butz
Dude... no way...

*Payne
The victim was a model, but
did not have a large income.

*Payne
It appears that she had
several "Sugar Daddies."

*Butz
Daddies?
Sugar?

*Payne
Yes. Older men, who gave
her money and gifts.

*Payne
She took their money and used
it to support her lifestyle.

*Butz
Duuude!

*Payne
We can clearly see what kind
of woman this Ms. Stone was.

*Payne
Tell me, Mr. Butz, what do
you think of her now?

*Mia
Wright...

*Mia
I don't think you want
him to answer that question.

*Phoenix
(Yeah... Larry has a way of
running his mouth in all
the wrong directions.)


++
[QCM]->4

*Butz
I'm gonna die.
I'm just gonna drop dead!

++
[STOP_MUSIC]

*Butz
Yeah, and when I meet her in
the afterlife...

*Butz
I'm going to get to the bottom
of this!

++
[JUDGE_HAMMER]->1

*Judge
Let's continue with the trial,
shall we?

*Payne
I believe the accused's
motive is clear to everyone.

*Judge
Yes, quite.

*Phoenix
(Oh boy. This is so not
looking good.)

++
[START_MUSIC_TRIAL]

*Payne
Next question!

*Payne
You went to the victim's
apartment on the day of
the murder, did you not?

*Butz
Gulp!

*Payne
Well, did you, or did you not?

*Butz
Heh? Heh heh. Well, maybe
I did, and maybe I didn't!

*Phoenix
(Uh oh. He went.)

++
[QCM]->5

*Judge
Well, that simplifies matters.
Who is your witness?

*Payne
The man who found
the victim's body.

*Payne
Just before making the
gruesome discovery...

*Payne
He saw the defendant fleeing
the scene of the crime!

++
[PUBLIC_TALK]

++
[JUDGE_HAMMER]->3

*Judge
Order! Order in the court!

*Judge
Mr. Payne, the prosecution
may call its witness.

*Payne
Yes, Your Honor.

++
[START_MUSIC_TRIAL]	

*Phoenix
(This is bad...)

*Payne
On the day of the murder, my
witness was selling newspapers
at the victim's building.

*Payne
Please bring Mr. Frank Sahwit
to the stand!

++
[WITNESS]->2

*Payne
Mr. Sahwit, you sell newspaper
subscriptions, is this correct?

*Sahwit
Oh, oh yes!
Newspapers, yes!

*Judge
Mr. Sahwit, you may
proceed with your testimony.

*Judge
Please tell the court what
you saw on the day of the
murder.

++
[TESTIMONY]->1

++
[STOP_MUSIC]

*Judge
Hmm...

*Phoenix
(Larry! Why didn't you
tell the truth?)

*Phoenix
(I can't defend you against
a testimony like that!)

*Judge
Incidentally, why wasn't
the phone in the victim's
apartment working?

*Payne
Your Honor, at the time of
the murder, there was a
blackout in the building.

*Judge
Aren't phones supposed to
work during a blackout?

*Payne
Yes, Your Honor...

*Payne
However, some cordless phones
do not function normally.

*Payne
The phone that Mr. Sahwit
used was one of those.

*Payne
Your Honor...

*Payne
I have a record of the
blackout, for your perusal.

Blackout Record added
to the Court Record.

++
[EVIDENCE]->4

*Judge
Now, Mr. Wright...

*Phoenix
Yes!
Er... yes, Your Honor?

*Judge
You may begin your
cross-examination.

*Phoenix
C-Cross-examination,
Your Honor?

*Mia
Alright, Wright, this is it.
The real deal!

*Phoenix
Uh... what exactly am I
supposed to do?

*Mia
Why, you expose the lies in
the testimony the witness
just gave!

*Phoenix
Lies! What?! He was lying!?

*Mia
Your client is innocent,
right?

*Mia
Then that witness must have
lied in his testimony!

*Mia
Or is your client really...
guilty?

*Phoenix
!!! How do I prove he's not?

*Mia
You hold the key!
It's in the evidence!

*Mia
Compare the witness's
testimony to the
evidence at hand.

*Mia
There's bound to be a
contradiction in there!

*Mia
First find contradictions
between the Court Record
and the witness's testimony.

*Mia
Then, once you've found the
contradicting evidence...

*Mia
present it and rub
it in the witness's face!

*Phoenix
Um... okay.

*Mia
Touch the Court Record button
and point out contradictions
in the testimony!

[OBJECTION_STANCE]

*Phoenix
++
[END_OBJECTION_STANCE]
You found the body at 1:00 PM.
You're sure?

*Sahwit
Yes.
It was 1:00 PM, for certain.

*Phoenix
Frankly, I find that
[DESK_SLAM]->Phoenix Wright
hard to believe!

++
[OBJECTION_MUSIC]

*Phoenix
Your statement directly
contradicts the autopsy report.

*Phoenix
The autopsy notes the time
of death at sometime after
4PM.

*Phoenix
There was nobody to... er...
no "body" to find at 1:00 PM!

*Phoenix
How do you explain this
three-hour gap?

*Sahwit
!!!

*Sahwit
Oh, that! Oh, er...

++
[OBJECTION]->Payne

*Payne
This is trivial! The witness
merely forgot the time!

*Judge
After his testimony, I find
that hard to believe.

*Judge
Mr. Sahwit...

*Judge
Why were you so certain
that you found the body
at 1:00 PM?

*Sahwit
I.. er... well, I...
Gee, that's a really good
question!

*Mia
Great job, Wright!
Way to put him on the spot!

*Mia
That's all you have to do:
point out contradictions!

*Mia
Lies always beget more lies!

*Mia
See through one, and their
whole story falls apart!

*Sahwit
Wait!
I remember now!

*Judge
Would you care to give
your testimony again?

[TESTIMONY]->2

[STOP_MUSIC]

*Judge
Hmm... I see.
You heard a voice saying
the time on a taped program.

*Judge
Mr. Wright, you may cross-
examine the witness.

*Mia
Wright!

*Mia
You know what to do!

*Phoenix
I've got this one.

[CROSS_EXAM]->2

[OBJECTION_STANCE]
*Phoenix
[END_OBJECTION_STANCE]

*Phoenix
Hold it right there!

*Phoenix
The prosecution has said there
was a blackout at the time of
the discovery!

*Phoenix
And this record proves it!

*Sahwit
...!

*Phoenix
[DESK_SLAM]->Phoenix Wright
You couldn't have heard
a television... or a video!

*Sahwit
Gah!!!

*Sahwit
I... well... urk!

*Judge
The defense has a point.

*Judge
Do you have an explanation
for this, Mr. Sahwit?

*Sahwit
No, I... I find it quite
puzzling myself! Quite!

*Sahwit
...

*Sahwit
Aah!

*Sahwit
W-wait!
I remember now!

*Judge
Mr. Sahwit?

*Judge
The court would prefer to hear
an accurate testimony from the
very beginning.

*Judge
These constant corrections
are harming your credibility.

*Judge
That, and you seem
rather... distraught.

*Sahwit
...!

*Sahwit
M-my apologies, Your Honor!

*Sahwit
It... er, it must have
been the shock of finding
the body!

*Judge
Very well, Mr. Sahwit.

*Judge
Let's hear your testimony
once more please.

[TESTIMONY]->3
[STOP_MUSIC]

*Judge
You saw a clock?
I guess that would explain it.

*Judge
The defense may cross-
examine the witness.

*Phoenix
Gladly.

[OBJECTION_STANCE]
*Phoenix
[END_OBJECTION_STANCE]

*Phoenix
Wait just a moment!

*Phoenix
[DESK_SLAM]->Phoenix Wrigth
The murder weapon wasn't
a clock.
It was this statue!

[CORNERED]
*Phoenix
Now how is this supposed
to be a clock?

*Sahwit
Whaa!?

*Sahwit
Y-you with your "objections,"
and your "evidence"... Just
who do you think you are!?

*Phoenix
Just answer the question,
Mr. Sahwit.

*Sahwit
Hey, I... I saw it there, okay!
That's a clock!

*Payne
Your Honor!
If I may...

*Judge
Yes, Mr. Payne?

*Payne
As the witness stated, this
statue is indeed a clock.

*Payne
The neck is a switch. You just
tilt it, and it says the time
out loud.

*Payne
As it doesn't look like a
clock, I submitted it as a
statue. My apologies.

*Judge
I see.

*Judge
So the murder weapon was a
table clock after all.

*Judge
Well, Mr. Wright?

*Judge
It appears that the witness's
testimony was correct.
This is a clock.

[QCM]->6

*Phoenix
The only way he could have
known the weapon was a clock
is to hold it in his hand.

*Phoenix
Yet the witness testified
that he never entered the
apartment!

*Phoenix
[DESK_SLAM]->Phoenix Wrigth
Clearly, a contradiction!

*Judge
Hmm... indeed!

[QCM]->6

*Phoenix
The only way he could have
known the weapon was a clock

apartment!

*Phoenix
[DESK_SLAM]->Phoenix Wrigth
Clearly, a contradiction!

*Judge
Hmm... indeed!

[QCM]->7

*Phoenix
You struck her with the clock,
and the shock of the blow
triggered the clock's voice!

*Phoenix
That was the sound you heard!

++
[PUBLIC_TALK]


*Judge
[JUDGE_HAMMER]->1
Order in the court!

++
[CORNERED]

*Judge
Intriguing.
Please continue, Mr. Wright.

*Phoenix
Yes, Your Honor.

*Phoenix
Mr. Sahwit.

*Phoenix
The sound must have left
quite an impression on you.

*Phoenix
Understandable, since the
murder weapon spoke just as
you hit the victim!

*Phoenix
That voice was burned
into your mind.

*Phoenix
That's why you were so
certain about the time!

[OBJECTION]->Payne

*Payne
W-w-what's the meaning
of this?

*Payne
This is all baseless
conjecture!

*Phoenix
Baseless...?

*Phoenix
[OBJECTION_STANCE]
Just look at the
witness's face!

*Sahwit
Ngh... grrrah!
[END_OBJECTION_STANCE]

*Judge
Would the witness
care to elaborate?

*Judge
Did you strike the
victim with the clock?

*Sahwit
I... I...!
That... that day...
I... I never!

*Sahwit
Look... I... the clock...
I heard, no!
I mean, I saw...Saw... nggg!

[PAUSE_MUSIC]
*Sahwit
Gwaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

*Sahwit
Shutupshutupshutup!
I hate you!

*Sahwit
I-it was him, I tell you!
I saw him!

*Sahwit
H-he killed her and he
should burn! Burn!
Give him death!

++
[PUBLIC_TALK]

*Judge
[JUDGE_HAMMER]->1
Order!
Order in the court I say!

[PAUSE_MUSIC]
*Payne
Your Honor,
a-a moment please!

*Payne
There isn't a shred of
evidence supporting the
defense's claims!

*Judge
Mr. Wright!

*Phoenix
Your Honor?

*Judge
You claim the sound the
witness heard came from
the clock...

*Judge
Do you have any evidence?

*Phoenix
(The whole case is riding
on this! I'd better think
it through carefully!)

*Phoenix
Yes, Your Honor.

*Phoenix
The sound Mr. Sahwit heard
was definitely this clock.

*Phoenix
A fact which is clear
if you simply...
