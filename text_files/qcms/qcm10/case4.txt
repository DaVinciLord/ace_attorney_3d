[CASE_1]
*Phoenix
All you have to do
is examine the batteries!

*Judge
Indeed? The batteries are...
in the right way. The clock
seems to be working fine.

*Judge
What exactly did
you mean, Mr. Wright?

*Phoenix
Yes, the clock was
working fine!

*Payne
Yes, and...?

*Phoenix
...

*Phoenix
Umm, I'm sorry, I think
I got confused back there
with all those testimonies.

*Judge
Mr. Wright!

*Judge
I expect more from a lawyer
in this court. Even if it
is your first day.

*Judge
I'm afraid I have to
penalize you! Try to think
things through more carefully.

*Phoenix
Y-yes, Your Honor.
As I was saying...
