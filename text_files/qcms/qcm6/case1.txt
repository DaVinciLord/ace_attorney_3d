[CASE_1]
*Phoenix
I guess not.

*Phoenix
There was a clock on the
scene, so, no problem.

*Mia
Wright! Are you out
of your mind!?

*Mia
That clock doesn't look
like a clock at all!

*Mia
The witness couldn't have
possibly known it was a clock
just by seeing it!

*Mia
He said himself, he never
entered the apartment!

*Mia
It was in his testimony!

*Phoenix
Hey!
You're right!

*Judge
Is something the matter?
Does the defense have anything
to add?

*Phoenix
Yes...
Yes I do!
