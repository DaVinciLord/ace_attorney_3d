[CASE_2]
*Phoenix
Tell me, isn't it true that
you knew the victim?

*Phoenix
In fact, you were one of her
"sugar daddies"! Be frank
with us, Mr. Sahwit!

*Sahwit
Hmph.

*Sahwit
"Frank"? I'm always "Frank"!

*Payne
Your Honor.

*Payne
We have complete records of
the victim's relationships.

*Payne
Mr. Frank Sahwit does
not appear anywhere.

*Phoenix
[END_OBJECTION_STANCE]
Huh?
Oh, really?

*Judge
Please, Mr. Wright...
Is "Huh" the best response
you can muster up?

*Judge
Try to refrain from making
off-the-cuff accusations
in the future.

*Phoenix
Y-yes, Your Honor.
Let me think this over.
