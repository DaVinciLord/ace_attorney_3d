[CASE_2]
*Phoenix
All you have to do is talk
to the victim's neighbors!

*Judge
Talk to the neighbors...?

*Phoenix
I'm sure one of them heard
the clock tell the time when
the incident occurred!

*Judge
I see...

*Judge
Does the prosecution have
anything to say, Mr. Payne?

*Payne
We have already made all
the necessary inquiries.

*Payne
Everyone living near the
victim's apartment was out
at the time of the murder.

*Payne
Furthermore, even if a
neighbor had heard the clock,

*Payne
that would not prove that
Mr. Sahwit had heard anything.

*Judge
Hmm...
That is true.

*Judge
I believe you may be wrong,
Mr. Wright.

*Judge
You'll receive a penalty
for that, unfortunately.

*Phoenix
I-I'm sorry, Your Honor!
Let me think about it again!
