Mr. Wright?

This is your first trial,
is it not?

Y-Yes, Your Honor.
I'm, um, a little nervous.

trial will decide the fate
of your client.

Murder is a serious charge.
For your client's sake, I hope

Mr. Wright, given the
circumstances...

I think we should have a test
to ascertain your readiness.

Yes, Your Honor.

Eyesight... fading...)
